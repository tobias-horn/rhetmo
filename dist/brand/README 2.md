Place your logo here.

- Add your primary logo as `logo.svg` (preferred) or `logo.png` in this folder.
- Reference it in the app via `/brand/logo.svg` (Vite serves everything under `public` at the root).
- If you have multiple variants, use names like `logo-dark.svg`, `logo-light.svg`, or `icon.svg`.
